# Very Simple Compiler (built with ReasonML)

This tiny compiler will compile lisp-like function calls into C-like function calls.
It's based on this video by James Kyle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tar4WgAfMr4&t=581s

It's not done yet. The tokenizer and parser are finished.
The tokenizer will split code into tokens and the parser will reformat them into an Abstract syntax tree.
